# Geometry UI Homework Problem

**Problem statement:** Using Javascript, please create a function that, given any point and a hollow, closed cylinder, determines the distance from the point to the surface of the cylinder, and a React GUI with elegant, interactive visualizations to exercise this function.

You will need to determine how to represent points and cylinders. You can assume Cartesian coordinates and Euclidean geometry.

We are looking for code that is both correct and maintainable. Your submission should be buildable and runnable on a Windows or Mac computer (provide instructions).
